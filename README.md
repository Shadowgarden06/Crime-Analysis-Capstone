# Crime-Analysis-Capstone
Capstone Project for Data Mining – Crime data analysis using Python, Power BI, and Excel

1. Introduction
The Crime Analysis Capstone project is a comprehensive data analytics and visualization initiative that aims to examine crime patterns, trends, and distributions using publicly available datasets from the Crime Statistics Agency (Victoria).
By leveraging techniques in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and dashboard reporting, this project seeks to:

Understand the types of crimes most prevalent in Victoria.

Identify geographical hotspots for various offenses.

Detect temporal patterns such as seasonal or monthly crime fluctuations.

Provide actionable insights to inform decision-making and public awareness.

The project workflow includes:

Data Acquisition – Downloading datasets from the official source.

Data Preparation – Cleaning, transforming, and standardizing the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing patterns, distributions, and correlations.

Statistical/ML Modeling – Applying predictive or explanatory models where applicable.

Dashboard Reporting – Presenting findings via an interactive Power BI dashboard.

This capstone is a collaborative effort, with clearly defined tasks for each team member to ensure effective workflow and accountability.
